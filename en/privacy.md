# Mapori Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** August 13, 2025

LazyWorkers ("the Company," "we," "us," or "our") values the privacy of users of the Mapori app ("the Service") and complies with relevant data protection laws worldwide, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This policy provides information regarding the personal information processed in the operation of the Service.

### Article 1 (Principle of Minimum Collection and Non-Collection of Personal Information)
The Company operates on a principle of privacy by design. We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information on our servers. The Service does not have a separate user registration process, and therefore, we do not request or collect personal information that can directly identify a user, such as name, email address, or contact number.

### Article 2 (Information Access for Service Functionality)
To provide the core features of the Service, the Company may request access to the following information. However, this information is processed only within the user's device and is not transmitted to or stored on the Company's servers.

- **Location Information:** To display the user's records (stickers) on the map, the Service accesses the device's location information. This information is used on a one-time basis to place a record and is not tracked or stored by the Company.
- **Photos and Camera:** When a user creates a sticker or attaches a photo to a record, the Service accesses the photo library or camera. The photo data selected by the user is processed and stored locally on the device and is not transmitted to the Company's servers.

### Article 3 (Storage and Management of User Data)
- All content created by the user within the Service (stickers, photos, memos, tags, etc., collectively "User Content") is stored only on the user's personal device.
- When subscribing to 'Mapori Pro,' for data synchronization and backup features, the user's data is, at their option, securely stored and managed through their personal Apple iCloud account in an encrypted state.
- Data stored in iCloud is managed according to Apple's Privacy Policy. The Company has no technical means to access, view, or decrypt the user's encrypted data. Full control over the data rests solely with the user.

### Article 4 (Rights of Data Subjects and How to Exercise Them)
As all User Content is stored on the user's device or in their personal iCloud, the user has direct and full control over their data. This means users can directly exercise their rights as guaranteed by regulations like GDPR.

- **Right to Access, Rectification, and Erasure:** Users can freely access, modify, and delete the content stored on their devices at any time directly within the app.
- **iCloud Data Management:** When using the iCloud sync feature, users can directly manage and delete their data stored in their iCloud space using tools provided by Apple. The responsibility for data management and deletion lies with the user.

### Article 5 (Destruction of Personal Information)
As the Company does not separately collect or store personal information on its servers, there is no information for us to destroy. When a user deletes the app, all User Content stored within the device is deleted simultaneously. Data stored in iCloud will remain unless separately deleted by the user from their iCloud account.

### Article 6 (Paid Service Payments)
All payments for 'Mapori Pro' subscriptions or paid sticker packs are securely processed through the Apple App Store's in-app purchase system. The Company does not collect, access, or store any financial information, such as credit card details.

### Article 7 (Protection of Children's Privacy)
The Service is not intended for children under the age of 14 (or the equivalent minimum age for digital consent in the relevant jurisdiction). The Company does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child's personal information has been collected without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.

### Article 8 (Additional Information for International Users)
The Company respects the privacy regulations of each region in providing its global service.

- **For Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, and Switzerland:** The Company does not process or transfer users' personal information across borders. User Content is stored on the device or in the user's personal iCloud account. For the purposes of GDPR, while the Company is the data controller for the Service itself, the user acts as the data controller for their own User Content, as they have sole control over its storage and management. Data processing is subject to the user's choices and Apple's policies.
- **For Residents of California, USA:** In accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), the Company explicitly states that it does not "sell" or "share" (for cross-context behavioral advertising) users' personal information. Users can exercise their rights to access and delete their information by directly managing the data stored on their devices and in their iCloud accounts.

### Article 9 (Contact Information)
The Company has designated a contact person for privacy-related inquiries and complaints.
- **Privacy Contact:** SeonJae Kim
- **Email:** lineash4051@gmail.com

### Article 10 (Changes to the Privacy Policy)
Should this Privacy Policy be amended, the Company will notify users of any material changes through in-app notices or other appropriate means at least 7 days prior to the effective date.
